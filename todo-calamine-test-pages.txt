---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://uncovercalifornia.com/content/22147-gunman-suspected-carrying-out-attacks-arrested
- actual was only element with 'article'
- fixed by removing 'span.printfriendly-node'

- better would be to restrict class='article' to just div/article

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/00076419.html
- no longer an issue
- but I dont like how i solved it
- without attribute weighting this finds the wrong stuff

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.people.com/article/hillary-clinton-granddaughter-charlotte-advice
- missed main image

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.thestate.com/2014/10/02/3719833/which-party-will-win-the-senate.html
- dynamically renders contnt based on whether first-visit cookie is set. so it fails
on first visit and works perfectly on second

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-19/us-led-coalition-strikes-pound-more-islamic-state-targets-in-ko/5824688
- found a random image instead of the article
- target: <div class="article section">
- actual: anchor containing image with, child of li, nested within target
- the main article contains a list. the actual was in the list. the list has a bunch of
anchors. as a result the main article gets a HUGE anchor char count, which results in a
very large negative text bias
- changed around handling of class "article".
- penalize list descendants more
- penalize anchors intrinsic more

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- all new york times rss feeds - unclear what the issue is but nothing appears, may
even be related to feed parsing
- works fine when tested via google news redirect


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/10/09/ahs-freak-show-jessica-lange-life-on-mars/
- only found the leader image, did not include the text

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/business-it/hp-split-a-uturn-in-meg-whitmans-changefilled-career-20141006-10qsk6.html
- works in test but not in slides
- ok, i think it is because this is from within the feed itself, because the url could not be fetched


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1e4d4c68-4d48-11e4-bf60-00144feab7de.html

http://www.theaustralian.com.au/in-depth/terror/tony-abbott-gives-green-light-to-raaf-airstrikes-in-iraq/story-fnpdbcmu-1227079646252
- paywall, reached monthy limit

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-29499682
- missed target, looks like because of class weights (tokens "article", "story")
- added div.related-items to blacklist
- this causes it to match the text, but, it misses the leading image

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.thestate.com/2014/10/05/3725890/orman-opens-up-big-lead-over-roberts.html
- another example where the content appears in the text context and works exactly as
desired, but does not work in slides

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://aeon.co/magazine/philosophy/tim-lott-zen-buddhism-alan-watts/
- generally worked but missed leading image

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20141004/sports/141009186/
- the approach generally works, but it misses the lead image because it is is an outer box
and this only finds the inner box. maybe because p only biases its immediate ancestor.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem pages that have been reviewed and not fully solved
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/10/silk-road-lawyers-poke-holes-in-fbis-story/
- in this page, there is an element near end of <head>,
<HTTP-EQUIV="PRAGMA" CONTENT="NO-CACHE">.
Chrome shoves everything under this (incorrectly) then it gets removed by lucu.removeUnknownElements
and as a result the page is blank. to fix this, I stopped removing unknown elements
- now this has a second minor issue. the best element is generally correct but it includes
comments

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.foxnews.com/leisure/2014/09/29/get-your-free-caffeiene-fix-on-national-coffee-day/
templating:initrequestcontext
- another custom element that i dont support
- adding it made it work perfectly


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.krmg.com/news/news/local/15-people-wounded-gunfire-including-five-children/nhXhk/
- it sort of worked, but it didn't exactly find the whole article (cmArticleWell), which
is preferred

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.modbee.com/2014/09/29/3563980/police-many-minors-at-site-of.html

- finding a piece of the article instead of the whole thing. maybe due to the large image
- this issue appears to be common to recode pages. i find something but not the right thing.
- suggests some attribute bias is off or im filtering something i should not
- some re/code pages have worked, however.
- there is a clear pattern where i mistakenly identify the leading image instead of the text



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.betawired.com/4-year-old-boy-from-nj-died-of-ev-d68/146246/
- failed in slides but works perfectly in test context


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://blogs.gentoo.org/blueness/2014/10/04/lilblue-linux-release-20140925-adventures-beyond-the-land-of-posix/
- unclear issue, this works perfeclty in test context but not in slides

http://blogs.gentoo.org/blueness/2014/10/03/sthttpd-a-very-tiny-and-very-fast-http-server-with-a-mature-codebase/
- a repeat of above issue, this works perfectly in test but not in slides for unknown reason

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/watch-rochester-cloak-uses-ordinary-lenses-to-hide-objects-across-continuous-range-of-angles-70592/
- remote page is completely empty, i guess not my fault? would be nice to see a message
about 'no content' here instead.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://number-none.com/blow/john_carmack_on_inlined_code.html
- finding a piece of the content instead of all of it
- it is because the root is body, which is -Infinity
- not sure what to do. this should be possible. but allowing body means
greater risk of always finding body as best

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/09/26/3399685/challenges-remain-in-missing-uva.html
- unclear, not seeing the content, maybe dynamically rendered?
- nevermind, it worked. it is like, chrome sometimes randomly fails to serve up the
content, like the http request failed? but _some_ content was delivered, so why would
that happen?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://practicaltypography.com/economics-year-one.html
- custom element "root"
- custom element "topic"
- i added support for these, then it worked perfectly. however, i am leaving this here
as another indicator that I need to somehow support custom elements
- minor xss risk of custom elements here because they could be scripts, disabled due to
no inline but how else to allow?
- uses 'aside' in a manner similar to blockquote. aside can be downweighted
but it should not be filtered


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/09/consumer-reports-tests-iphone-6-bendgate/index.htm
- Consumer Reports uses large amounts of whitespace in certain sections. I was counting characters
naively that included this. Now we trim each node value before counting. This fixes the error.
- However, I am leaving this here as a note. I thought this issue was resolved by sanitize
pre-trimming nodes. Apparently something is wrong with sanitize.

- now something is seriously wrong here. this works on calamine-test but not in slides. what could
possibly explain the diff? maybe failed to retrieve at poll fetch time?
- also, is there a way to skip the feedsportal redirect?

-----------------------------
https://a16z.com/2014/09/11/apples-new-phones-a-direct-move-against-premium-android/

- conditional paywall ("you have viewed your allowance of 10 articles...")

-----------------------------
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/22/climate-march-photos-new-york-city_n_5862430.html
- not a calamine error, this is an error in calamine test or something where an image
was not properly resolved. maybe due to background-url property

-----------------------------
http://abcnews.go.com/US/protesters-loot-store-ferguson-fire-destroyed-michael-brown/story?id=25718679
- itemprop="articleBody" is used for every element in the article (e.g. every p tag)
- rethink about the bias for article body, special case it like the article intrinsic bias?
- itemtype="http://schema.org/NewsArticle" was used in the target element
- fixed by special casing articlebody attribue value bias

-----------------------------
http://code.iamcal.com/php/rfc822/full_regexp.txt
??? no html

-----------------------------
http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/two-killed-in-explosions-in-china-s-xinjiang-114092200897_1.html
- uses http://schema.org/Article, so supporting itemtype bias would partly solve it
- target had score of 180
- actual had score of 194.7

the thing is, despite it being such a small amount of text, there was almost no other text on the page
worthwhile. maybe p should have a greater effect on its ancestors?

- actual contains value "article" in class attribute but otherwise has junk in it
- reducing weight for article attribute bias would partly solve it (but cause problems everywhere else)
- actual was within div with id "popup-box", if we propagate down attribute biases it would partly
solve it


-----------------------------


http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins/article2198644.html
- completely missed the article, this is bad
- it is because there are multiple article elements, intrinsic bias fails in this
case
- solved by creating special case for intrinsic bias of article elements


-----------------------------
Salon
http://www.salon.com/2014/09/21/the_colossal_dea_failure_that_prevented_a_potentially_major_medical_breakthrough/
- it identified only a subsection of the article
- added "articlecontent" bias +1000, fixed the problem
- however, leaving this here as a good reference example of the problems near the edge
- at time of testing it was 4300 for nested and 4000 for full article, so the nested beat out
full by just 300. but why is that? maybe i need to propagate the "contains p" farther up the
domtree?

-----------------------------
http://www.wired.com/2014/09/martellus-map/
- the algorithm worked. what is throwing me off is chromes handling of displays when nesting
block content in a non-block context. this page has a wrapping span element that is identified as
the best element, and it is the best one. not sure why this was added as problem.

-----------------------------
The New Yorker
http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/climate-march-slideshow

They have this slideshow component that requires more research. The imgs have a data-src attribute not
a src attribute. They are definitely rendered somehow (background style?) when viewed in chrome but src
property is empty and src attribute is empty.

The correct section was found, it is more a problem maybe with sanitize or something

http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/09/19/neeson-season-liam-films-ranked-from-worst-to-best/
- <templating:initRequestContext var="rc"/>
- gets removed as unknown
- unfortunately, this is really strange. chrome is treating all siblings as children. almost
like it's a bug in chrome


-----------------------------
Kansas City
http://www.kansascity.com/sports/mlb/kansas-city-royals/article2185897.html
Uses <article> several times as references to other articles and not just
for the main article content. Which means intrinsic bias over emphasizes
the article element in the case of several article elements where article is not
used exclusively to refer to the target content.

A couple of things to fix this:
- reduce the intrinsic bias of the article element
- 3 cases: no article element, one element, n elements. normal bias in no/one, minor bias in n
- the undesired <article> fall within axis with attributes like 'more-stories', 'headline-list',
and '-side-', which means that attributes should probably propagate downward. maybe at an
adjusted or proportional amount. maybe only if negative


-----------------------------
http://www.freep.com/article/20140912/NEWS07/309120108/T-J-Lane-Ohio-school-shooter-recaptured
http://www.freep.com/article/20140910/ENT07/309100069/Charlie-Hunnam-Fifty-Shades-of-Grey

There is an unclosed tag <pbss:script>. Chrome treats all subsequent siblings as descendants.
lucu.removeUnknownElements encounters it and removes it, as desired, which results in removing the
content.

Finds <esi:include src="/ugc/v2/dock.html"/>. Removes as unknown.
This is a unary tag (/>), but Chrome treats it as non-unary and moves all following content
under it. Hence the entire article body is stripped of content. Not sure what I can do
short of writing a more tolerant HTML parser that recognizes unary tags like the above.
I could write a hack that rewrites esi:include to something else, or unwraps it.
Maybe it is an XHTML issue? For now I am chucking this into the garbage bin of 'cannot handle'.

The content is beneath the body tag. Knew about this problem beforehand. So this serves as a great example
of the need to support it. Maybe start with body 0 instead of -Infinity?

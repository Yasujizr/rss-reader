// NOTE: the assert here is implied. does the function execute without rejection

// TODO: this should be testing different modules. indexeddb_open and
// indexeddb_remove were split into separate modules. There should be separate
// tests? Except that we need to really delete the db in the open test so ...?
// Also test create vs upgrade case, assert that onupgradeneeded happens
// Test that timeout vs no-timeout works as expected
// Test error paths


// TODO: this test is failing, indexeddb_remove never resolves. On applications
// tab, the details for the database that was created are missing, and the
// buttons for delete and refresh do not work (and are opaque). Somehow this is
// basically creating a database in some kind of bad state

// NOTE: disabled this test while trying to test other things

There is an unclosed tag <pbss:script>. Chrome treats all subsequent siblings as descendants.
lucu.removeUnknownElements encounters it and removes it, as desired, which results in removing the
content.

Finds <esi:include src="/ugc/v2/dock.html"/>. Removes as unknown.
This is a unary tag (/>), but Chrome treats it as non-unary and moves all following content
under it. Hence the entire article body is stripped of content. Not sure what I can do
short of writing a more tolerant HTML parser that recognizes unary tags like the above.
I could write a hack that rewrites esi:include to something else, or unwraps it.
Maybe it is an XHTML issue? For now I am chucking this into the garbage bin of 'cannot handle'.

This works now, but hackishly. The algorithm is weak on this page.

Bustle is one of thoes obnoxious JS-required sites. Uses Ember templating. Probably going to just
ignore them.

TODO: is there any way to access blogspot content?

The irony of open source, the content is inaccessible

The content is beneath the body tag. Knew about this problem beforehand. So this serves as a great example
of the need to support it. Maybe start with body 0 instead of -Infinity?

#TODO

* chrome now uses material design for options pages
* remove subscription preview
* lookup favicons after displaying search results, not before
* listen for poll events, feed information may have updated
* add back button behavior for switching sections (history.popstate stuff)
* remove unreadable fonts
* app wide, consider going back to a single page application and think of how
to integrate all of this into the slideshow page

The `create_feed` function creates a new feed in storage

### TODOS
 * documentation
* testing that focuses exclusively on create_feed
* the prep stuff and validation stuff should probably be isolated somewhere, maybe as part of an objects folder, as helper to feed objects
* consider being redundant and not delegating to update_feed
* channel post stuff should probably be abstracted away a bit eventually
* probably should inline assert, deprecate helper

Modules related to the options page. Most of the functionality is present in options-page.js. There is not much to test.

I plan to deprecate the options page and move to a single page app. However there is quite a lot of code to shift over to the slideshow page. Also, I want to focus on a better UI.

I grew sick of the options page. For one, Google keeps changing how it works. Google changed the style of the options page too. Two, I like the idea of experimenting with a single page application (SPA). This is partly in preparation for toying with react or other view libraries. Three, it turns out it is pretty annoying to change display settings.

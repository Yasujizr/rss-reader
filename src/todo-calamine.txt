* review gebtn, maybe i do not need to keep calling it?
e.g. maybe i should just do a single querySelectorAll instead if its not-live?
or is it better to re-call it to avoid read-after-delete issues?

* support iframes and embed objects and audio/video
* for all iframes, set sandbox attribute?


* Turn into a rule-based processing system

* idea bout external vs internal links, diff weights
e.g. if same origin then +- x else +- y. internal i assume
to be more likely to be boilerplate because part of sites
template but articles tend to link to others. also more objective
because authors hate to link outside as anti-sticky. would
of course fail for in-content same origin links but as a whole
these are less likely.

* better credits to research papers

* move to completely external dependency

* better support for live document scrubbing

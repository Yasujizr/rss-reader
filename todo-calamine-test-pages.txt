http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/09/consumer-reports-tests-iphone-6-bendgate/index.htm
- Consumer Reports uses large amounts of whitespace in certain sections. I was counting characters
naively that included this. Now we trim each node value before counting. This fixes the error.
- However, I am leaving this here as a note. I thought this issue was resolved by sanitize
pre-trimming nodes. Apparently something is wrong with sanitize.

- now something is seriously wrong here. this works on calamine-test but not in slides. what could
possibly explain the diff? maybe failed to retrieve at poll fetch time?
- also, is there a way to skip the feedsportal redirect?

-----------------------------
https://a16z.com/2014/09/11/apples-new-phones-a-direct-move-against-premium-android/
- sort of a redirect page. has no content, but its title a link to another blog...

-----------------------------
http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/22/climate-march-photos-new-york-city_n_5862430.html
- not a calamine error, this is an error in calamine test or something where an image
was not properly resolved. maybe due to background-url property

-----------------------------
http://abcnews.go.com/US/protesters-loot-store-ferguson-fire-destroyed-michael-brown/story?id=25718679
- itemprop="articleBody" is used for every element in the article (e.g. every p tag)
- rethink about the bias for article body, special case it like the article intrinsic bias?
- itemtype="http://schema.org/NewsArticle" was used in the target element
- fixed by special casing articlebody attribue value bias

-----------------------------
http://code.iamcal.com/php/rfc822/full_regexp.txt
??? no html

-----------------------------
http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/two-killed-in-explosions-in-china-s-xinjiang-114092200897_1.html
- uses http://schema.org/Article, so supporting itemtype bias would partly solve it
- target had score of 180
- actual had score of 194.7

the thing is, despite it being such a small amount of text, there was almost no other text on the page
worthwhile. maybe p should have a greater effect on its ancestors?

- actual contains value "article" in class attribute but otherwise has junk in it
- reducing weight for article attribute bias would partly solve it (but cause problems everywhere else)
- actual was within div with id "popup-box", if we propagate down attribute biases it would partly
solve it


-----------------------------


http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins/article2198644.html
- completely missed the article, this is bad
- it is because there are multiple article elements, intrinsic bias fails in this
case
- solved by creating special case for intrinsic bias of article elements


-----------------------------
Salon
http://www.salon.com/2014/09/21/the_colossal_dea_failure_that_prevented_a_potentially_major_medical_breakthrough/
- it identified only a subsection of the article
- added "articlecontent" bias +1000, fixed the problem
- however, leaving this here as a good reference example of the problems near the edge
- at time of testing it was 4300 for nested and 4000 for full article, so the nested beat out
full by just 300. but why is that? maybe i need to propagate the "contains p" farther up the
domtree?

-----------------------------
http://www.wired.com/2014/09/martellus-map/
- the algorithm worked. what is throwing me off is chromes handling of displays when nesting
block content in a non-block context. this page has a wrapping span element that is identified as
the best element, and it is the best one. not sure why this was added as problem.

-----------------------------
The New Yorker
http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/climate-march-slideshow

They have this slideshow component that requires more research. The imgs have a data-src attribute not
a src attribute. They are definitely rendered somehow (background style?) when viewed in chrome but src
property is empty and src attribute is empty.

The correct section was found, it is more a problem maybe with sanitize or something

-----------------------------
http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/09/19/neeson-season-liam-films-ranked-from-worst-to-best/
- <templating:initRequestContext var="rc"/>
- gets removed as unknown
- unfortunately, this is really strange. chrome is treating all siblings as children. almost
like it's a bug in chrome


-----------------------------
Kansas City
http://www.kansascity.com/sports/mlb/kansas-city-royals/article2185897.html
Uses <article> several times as references to other articles and not just
for the main article content. Which means intrinsic bias over emphasizes
the article element in the case of several article elements where article is not
used exclusively to refer to the target content.

A couple of things to fix this:
- reduce the intrinsic bias of the article element
- 3 cases: no article element, one element, n elements. normal bias in no/one, minor bias in n
- the undesired <article> fall within axis with attributes like 'more-stories', 'headline-list',
and '-side-', which means that attributes should probably propagate downward. maybe at an
adjusted or proportional amount. maybe only if negative

http://www.freep.com/article/20140910/ENT07/309100069/Charlie-Hunnam-Fifty-Shades-of-Grey

There is an unclosed tag <pbss:script>. Chrome treats all subsequent siblings as descendants.
lucu.removeUnknownElements encounters it and removes it, as desired, which results in removing the
content.

http://www.smh.com.au/national/muslim-community-apprehension-after-raids-leads-to-snap-protest-20140918-10iupz.html

Finds <esi:include src="/ugc/v2/dock.html"/>. Removes as unknown.
This is a unary tag (/>), but Chrome treats it as non-unary and moves all following content
under it. Hence the entire article body is stripped of content. Not sure what I can do
short of writing a more tolerant HTML parser that recognizes unary tags like the above.
I could write a hack that rewrites esi:include to something else, or unwraps it.
Maybe it is an XHTML issue? For now I am chucking this into the garbage bin of 'cannot handle'.

Obnoxious "JS-required" site. Uses Ember templating. Probably going to just ignore them?

The content is beneath the body tag. Knew about this problem beforehand. So this serves as a great example
of the need to support it. Maybe start with body 0 instead of -Infinity?

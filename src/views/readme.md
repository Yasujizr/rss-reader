# Views

Provides modules related to view code and utilities.

At the moment I've made the unusual decision to include css stylesheets, not
sure I like that.

I've also decided to just dump everything in a single folder. Not sure I like
that either. For one the different views have nothing to do with each other.
The only thing they really share is that they depend on some of the same
dependencies.

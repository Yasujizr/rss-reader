Problem pages

This is a problematic page. Aside from crap HTML and numerous spelling errors, such as
forgetting the 'b' in body in nearly all of the elements and attribute values, fictional
elements that improperly use HTML5 semantics guidelines (e.g. banner), there is an unclosed tag
<pbss:script>.  Chrome shoves siblings under it. The content is in
one of these siblings. removeUnknownElements encounters it and removes it, as desired,
but that results in removing the content. Chrome tolerates this when rendering the page
somehow. I cannot think of a simple workaround that is not overly specific. This is also a
vector due to script, so we cannot special case it easily. For now I am chucking this
into the garbage bin of 'cannot handle'.

Also fails due to pbss:script issue

Finds <esi:include src="/ugc/v2/dock.html"/>. Removes as unknown.
This is a unary tag, but Chrome treats it as non-unary and moves all following content
under it. Hence the entire article body is stripped of content. Not sure what I can do
short of writing a more tolerant HTML parser that recognizes unary tags like the above.
I could write a hack that rewrites esi:include to something else, or unwraps it.
Maybe it is an XHTML issue? For now I am chucking this
into the garbage bin of 'cannot handle'.

This works now, but hackishly. The algorithm is weak on this page.

It is finding a single paragraph instead of the article body. Change <article> intrinsic bias to 2000
to help, but this really needs more attention.

Missed. Maybe I need to use Set of attribute tokens? The best was
"block block-views wT1 more-politics grid-4 sidebar-more block-article-views-block-3 block-views-article-views-block-3 odd" and I think maybe due to mentioning article multiple times

Bustle is one of thoes obnoxious JS-required sites. Uses Ember templating. Probably going to just
ignore them.

TODO: is there any way to access blogspot content?

The irony of open source, the content is inaccessible

No idea, seems like a bug?

The content is beneat the body. Knew about this problem beforehand. So this serves as a great example
of the need to support it. Maybe start with body 0 instead of -Infinity?

* revisit whether favicons are now supported from within a chrome
extension. At least document very clearly why this library has to be used
in the alternative.
* lookup is simply too large and needs to be broken up into
* add a verbose param to lookup, possibly as part of options object
* add an options object to lookup that is passed around instead of accessing
globals, get things like timeouts from the object

- <templating:initRequestContext var="rc"/>
- gets removed as unknown
- unfortunately, this is really strange. chrome is treating all siblings as children. almost
like it's a bug in chrome

Kansas City
http://www.kansascity.com/sports/mlb/kansas-city-royals/article2185897.html
Uses <article> several times as references to other articles and not just
for the main article content. Which means intrinsic bias over emphasizes
the article element in the case of several article elements where article is not
used exclusively to refer to the target content.

A couple of things to fix this:
- reduce the intrinsic bias of the article element
- 3 cases: no article element, one element, n elements. normal bias in no/one, minor bias in n
- the undesired <article> fall within axis with attributes like 'more-stories', 'headline-list',
and '-side-', which means that attributes should probably propagate downward. maybe at an
adjusted or proportional amount. maybe only if negative

There is an unclosed tag <pbss:script>. Chrome treats all subsequent siblings as descendants.
lucu.removeUnknownElements encounters it and removes it, as desired, which results in removing the
content.

Finds <esi:include src="/ugc/v2/dock.html"/>. Removes as unknown.
This is a unary tag (/>), but Chrome treats it as non-unary and moves all following content
under it. Hence the entire article body is stripped of content. Not sure what I can do
short of writing a more tolerant HTML parser that recognizes unary tags like the above.
I could write a hack that rewrites esi:include to something else, or unwraps it.
Maybe it is an XHTML issue? For now I am chucking this into the garbage bin of 'cannot handle'.

This works now, but hackishly. The algorithm is weak on this page.

Obnoxious "JS-required" site. Uses Ember templating. Probably going to just ignore them?

The content is beneath the body tag. Knew about this problem beforehand. So this serves as a great example
of the need to support it. Maybe start with body 0 instead of -Infinity?

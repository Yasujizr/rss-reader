placeholder content. just jotting down the idea now, then getting back to it later.

i plan to write a blog post sharing my thoughts about the problem i just ran into in iconsvc.js using indexeddb.js, where i am trying to refactor the favicon-service code in the style of a microservice, and ran headfirst into a classical programming problem. i want to outline the problem here, and discuss the different solutions, and do a mediocre cost benefit analysis.

### TODOs
* perhaps think of badge as a view, like the other pages or the CLI. In that sense it would be reasonable to open a channel and listen for change events.
* even if I don't do the observer thing, thinking of badge as a page, like a view, like the other pages, is probably a good idea. I don't feel like it belongs in feed-ops anyway so that would be a big win.
* thinking about channels. The problem is that the channel must be persistent. Of course it would be wonderful to just use a persistent channel, for example, in the background page. But that will not work, because the background page is not persistent. A persistent channel there would either cause the background page to become unloadable and effectively persistent, or it would just not receive messages except when active. I cannot use the slideshow's listener. It is only available when the slideshow page is displayed, which is not always. So ... I need some kind of general listener that is used by every component in the app that modifies entry state related to read state, entry creation, or entry deletion. Or, I keep the current approach. Ok, what I could do is cheat somehow and use extension.getBackgroundPage()? That would load the page if not loaded

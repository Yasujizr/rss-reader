Misc thoughts on block weighting vs element hierarchy scoring



TODO: refactor to use block generation. Group list items together. Group
dds together, etc.
TODO: refactor to use block weighting. The return signature is simply
those blocks above a minimum threshold, which could be based on a
percentage of blocks to return value. But this time use the element
weighting technique. Consider treating divs as inline and using
only certain block parents (e.g. look for ul/ol/p/img/iframe as the only
allowable block segments).

TODO: do not necessarily exclude textnodes that are immediate children of body.
All top level text should probably be converted to paragraphs before scoring.

TODO: include other proximate or high scoring elements outside of the
best element, then rescan and filter out any extreme boilerplate
such as certain lists or ads. When building the frag, consider removing
each element from the original body such that each successive search for
another element does not have perform intersection tests.

TODO: the more I think about the above, the more I think I should go
back to blocks, but this time add in
hierarchical weighting. The crux of the problem then becomes how
pick the blocks to return. I would have to incorporate some better
all blocks in this element type of biasing that promotes blocks like
they do now, but also get rid of upward propagation.

NOTE: this wouldn't simplify the BR transform

NOTE: The fundamental problem is that I am not obtaining "all" of the desired
elements from the age because sometimes they are not all in the same block.
And when I do get the parent element right, sometimes I still end up
getting alot of nested boilerplate. At that point I would need to filter
the boilerplate, at which point I am nearly back to block score.
